## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since this project is maintained by a small team, we greatly appreciate any help from the community in identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities. If you discover a vulnerability, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Create an Issue:** Make a detailed issue report describing the vulnerability you found. Please include information on how to reproduce the issue, the potential impact, and any other relevant details. You can create an issue directly in our code repository.

2. **Investigation and Resolution:** As a small team, we will review the reported vulnerability promptly and conduct an investigation. If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work diligently to develop and test a fix.

3. **Security Update:** Once the vulnerability is verified and fixed, we will release a security update as soon as possible. The timeline for the update release will depend on the severity and complexity of the vulnerability.

4. **Acknowledgement:** We value the efforts of the community in helping us improve the security of our chat application. We will publicly acknowledge and credit the reporter for their contribution, unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

Since we have limited resources, please understand that it may take some time to address the reported vulnerability. However, we assure you that we will do our best to resolve it in a responsible and timely manner.

Thank you for supporting our project and contributing to its security. Your collaboration makes a significant difference in ensuring a safe experience for all our users.
