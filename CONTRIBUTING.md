# Introduction

### Thanks for thinking about contributing to our chat server!

> Following what is said here helps everyone: Pull requests get merged faster, bugs get fixed faster, and issues get answered/fixed faster

### What I'm looking for:

- UI/UX design changes, its not the best currently
- Documentation: it helps everyone in the long run, especially end-users
- Bug fixes/reports
- Fixes to support more users, new Python versions, new interpreters (PyPy as an example)
- Possibly some new features

### What I'm NOT looking for

- Complaints
- Feature requests that would violate copyright, or property of another person
- General Support questions for end-users

# Ground Rules
### What must be followed:

- Make sure all pull requests actually work, and do not break existing code
- For a major new feature (like the one mentioned in What I'm looking for), create a issue so we can keep track of what gets done when, and have a checklist of what needs to get done.
- Either have one major feature per version or a few smaller ones (small bug fixes/hotfixes), and not huge differences between versions.
- Don't be hurtful to new contributers; Instead, be constructive and show them what they did wrong.

# Your First Contribution

- The issues flagged as `good first issue` are ones that usually don't take a lot of effort, and should be easy for anyone to do.
- If the issue is flagged as `help wanted`, we really need people to finish this, and any help would be greatly apreciated.
- Any issue flagged as `Documentation` is a nice-to-have done whenever, and might make some issues have the `good first issue` added to them afterwards (snowball effect)

# Getting started
### How to submit a contribution
#### For all contributions:

1. Fork this repo
2. Do the changes in your fork (please name your commits for what you actually changed, and not just `bugfix`)
3. Test the changes, see if they work well, and the way you want them to:
4. Send a pull request with the right labels, and we'll look at it

# How to report a bug
### Security Issues

### If you find a security vulnerability, please do NOT open an issue. PLEASE email `cservergaming@gmail.com` or `alfredburford@icloud.com` instead with the subject line including `SECURITY ISSUE:`.
- You may also submit your security concern through Github's Security Advisories Section.

#### Make sure its a security issue beforehand though:

 Ask yourself these questions:
1. Should this not be acessable to the end user?
2. Is this exposing private infomation? (that could be used malicously)
3. Can something be disabled without authorization? (this should never apply hopefully)

If you answered yes to any of the above, please do what is mentioned above and email `cservergaming@gmail.com` or `alfredburford@icloud.com` or submit your security concern through Github's Security Advisories Section.

### Filing a bug report (not a security issue)

#### When filing an issue, please provide:

- The version of python and the version/commit of the chat server you are using
- The OS version
- What is off, or not expected
- Any errors reported in the console (PLEASE put this inside a code block using backticks, you can see how by looking up markdown styling)

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
### Ask these questions before sharing a new feature idea
This information will give contributors context before they make suggestions that may not align with the projectâ€™s needs.

- Check the milestones, see if it applies to any of the curent milestones
- Does this issue take a lot of work? We might not implement it if it takes months to implement
- Does this violate any copyright laws? (or the DMCA, or any other legal laws)
- Does this apply to a general purpose chat?
- See if the issue exists. If it does, show support so we see this is wanted by the community

# Code review process
### Who reviews pull requests?

- Currently, me (@cserver45) or cseven (@01000011-00110111) needs to review the pull request before it gets pushed into the repo.
